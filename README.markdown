## History

This project is based off the original [MIT Mobile Framework](https://github.com/MIT-Mobile/MIT-Mobile-Web) and was adapted for use at [Harvard University](https://github.com/modolabs/Harvard-Mobile-Web).
If you have followed the progress of the Harvard project you will notice some improvements and differences:

* Newer modules including video and HTML content
* An overhauled configuration system with web-based administration interface
* A robust authentication system with support for many types of authentication authorities
* Authorization support to restrict access to content by user or group
* Many other small improvements to ease in customization

There are some parts of the project that are not present:

* Modules that have not been generalized are not included. Please refer to the [Harvard Mobile Web Repository](https://github.com/modolabs/Harvard-Mobile-Web) for modules that you do not find here. Some modules will eventually be generalized and folded into this project.
