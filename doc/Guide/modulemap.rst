Map Module
##########

The map module allows you to browse and search for places and view them on a map.
Places may be grouped by campus, category, and subcategory.

============================
Configuring Campus Locations
============================

If an institution specifies multiple campuses, the home screen will show a list of campus locations.
If there is a single campus, the home screen will show a list of categories to browse by.

Campuses are configured in the *SITE_DIR/config/map/feedgroups.ini* file. Each separate campus has an section as follows:::

    [boston]
    title = "Boston Maps"
    center = "42.3584308,-71.0597732"
    address = "1 Massachusetts Ave., Boston MA 02115"
    description = "Description"

* The section title is the *id*, a short string to identify the campus. 
* *center* is the representative latitude and longitude of the campus.
* You can also include *address* and *description*

==============
Map View Types
==============

The map module currently supports five types of map views generators.

JavaScript based maps (compliant and tablet only)
-------------------------------------------------

* Google Maps
* ArcGIS JavaScript

Static image based maps
-----------------------
* Google Static Maps, 
* WMS
* ArcGIS *export* API 

==========================
Configuring Map Data Feeds
==========================

The map module currently supports two types of data sources for getting location information, KML and ArcGIS Server
(KML is recommended, although support for other data source types will be added in the future).
Each data feed is represented as a *category* that a user may browse by from the home screen or within a campus.

The feed configuration file is in *SITE_DIR/config/map/feeds-CAMPUS.ini* (where CAMPUS is the name of the campus section
in the feedgroups.ini file). Each feed has the following fields:

* *TITLE* is a descriptive name of the category that shows up on the map home screen (for single campuses) 
  or in the campus home screen
* *SUBTITLE* is an optional brief description that appears in small text alongside the title
* *BASE_URL* is the URL location of the data source.  This may be a file URL. (i.e. a path)
* *CONTROLLER_CLASS* is the data controller class associated with the type of data source.
  If the data source is KML, you should use *KMLDataController*.  For ArcGIS Server, you should use *ArcGISDataController*.
* *STATIC_MAP_CLASS* is the type of static map image used to display the map.
  This field is required as lower-end devices can only use static maps. Acceptable values are:

  * GoogleStaticMap
  * ArcGISStaticMap
  * WMSStaticMap
  
* *STATIC_MAP_BASE_URL* is the base URL of the map image server. This is not required for Google Static Maps.
* *JS_MAP_CLASS* is optional and refers to the type of JavaScript map to use on compliant/tablet devices.
  Acceptable values:

  * GoogleJSMap
  * ArcGISJSMap
  
* *DYNAMIC_MAP_BASE_URL* is the base URL of the map image server. This is not required for Google JavaScript Maps.
* *SEARCHABLE* is a boolean value that indicates whether or not this data source should be included in search results.
* *DEFAULT_ZOOM_LEVEL* is the default zoom level of the map image.
* If your insitution has multiple campuses, the *CAMPUS* field specifies which campus this data feed belongs to.
* If you want your data feed to be included in search results, but do not wish to make it a browseable category,
  you may set the optional *HIDDEN* value to 1


======================
Configuring Map Search
======================

The default map search traverses all KML feeds that have SEARCHABLE set to 1 and finds all Placemarks with a matching
title (or location for the "nearby" search that occurs on detail pages).
If you have an external search engine, you may override this behavior by subclassing MapSearch in your site lib directory
and specifying your class as MAP_SEARCH_CLASS in *SITE_DIR/config/map/module.ini*
